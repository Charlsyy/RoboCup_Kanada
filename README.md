# RoboCup_Kanada
Source code for a robot that navigates its way through a maze using multiple sensors competing at the
RoboCup Junior World-championship in Monteal, Canada.
The robot has to:  

  -navigate through a maze by orientating at the surrounding walls
  
  -identify black tiles on the ground
  
  -recognize heated 'victims' and deploy so-called 'rescue-kits'
  
  -drive ramps up and down
  
  -avoid obstacles
  
  -drive over bumpers on the ground
